                        Hyperspectral imaging captures and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike traditional imaging, which captures three bands (red, green, and blue), hyperspectral imaging divides the spectrum into many more bands, allowing the detection of subtle differences in materials. This technology is invaluable for applications ranging from agriculture to environmental monitoring.

                        Similarly, the mantis shrimp and butterflies have hyperspectral vision that cover a broader range of the spectrum (from deep ultraviolet to far-red light). This allows them to distinguish between different types of coral that all look the same to human eyes and distinguish between different flowers and leaves.

                        Hyperspectral imaging is crucial for monitoring crop health, detecting diseases, and optimizing irrigation in agriculture. It helps in detecting changes in land use, monitoring water quality, and predicting weather phenomena like rain. The technology is also used in mineral exploration, surveillance, and the detection of invasive species.

                        Butterflies are very nearsighted. While they can spot color and conspecifics, they cannot recognize patterns. In addition, their vision is monocular, not binocular like humans, making them unable to assess depth or distance in the same way we can. However, nature has made up for this in other ways. Some species of butterflies, like the empress Leilia (Asterocampa leilia), have a visual field of about 344 degrees on the horizontal plane--only 16 degrees short of seeing all the way around its body. And vertically it is almost a full 360 degrees. The average human has a visual field of only 190 degrees. This wide field of vision helps protect them from predators, particularly birds. Most butterfly species have visual fields that are equally impressive.

                        Although butterflies cannot see detailed patterns, some species do rely on colors, particularly colors that are not visible to human eyes, to find and consider a mate. Rutowski found that virgin females of the orange sulfur species, are able to visually assess the relative age and fitness of competing males using ultraviolet (UV) scales on the males' wings, and receptors in the female's eyes. These receptors allow the females to see UV wavelengths. <br><br>

                        The core of hyperspectral imaging technology lies in its ability to capture a wide range of wavelengths using advanced sensors and imaging techniques. These sensors capture hundreds of contiguous spectral bands, providing detailed information about the objects being observed. This data is processed using sophisticated algorithms to extract meaningful insights.

                        Hyperspectral imaging has the potential to revolutionize how we monitor and manage natural resources. With the ability to detect minute differences in the spectral signatures of various materials, it enables precise identification and monitoring of plant species, soil conditions, and water quality. This technology supports decision-making in agriculture, forestry, and environmental conservation.

                            Studying how animals like mantis shrimps see the world has led to a variety of practical applications now being developed in different laboratories around the world for human technologies and medicine. In common with mantis shrimp eyes, satellites use multiple spectral channels arranged in a strip to scan the world as they zoom over it before sending the information down to Earth.
                            Due to these similarities, insights based on understanding the colour receptors in a mantis shrimp’s eye can be used to inform designs for even better satellites and other visualisation processing that scans objects of interest, rather than taking a two-dimensional image as our eyes and normal cameras do.
                            Additionally, a large portion of photoreceptors in the mantis shrimp’s eye are used for visualising the UV and polarisation information in objects and scenes underwater. The polarisation element of mantis shrimp vision has inspired cancer detection methods that utilise this form of light in early detection of a variety of cancers invisible to the human eye.

                        Hyperspectral imaging is utilized globally for a variety of applications. For instance, it plays a significant role in environmental monitoring, helping scientists understand and predict natural phenomena such as coral bleaching and algal blooms. The future of hyperspectral imaging looks promising with advancements in sensor technology and data processing, leading to broader applications in areas like autonomous vehicles and space exploration. It also has many uses in the medical industry. This imaging modality is based on the principle that different tissues inherit different spectral reflectance responses that present as unique spectral fingerprints. HSI captures those composition-specific fingerprints to identify cancerous and normal tissues.
